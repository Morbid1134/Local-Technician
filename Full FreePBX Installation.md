# Full FreePBX Installation Guide
One thing that we handle for the occasional client is that they would like to have an intercom system with their phones. The way we have decided to implement this is by using FreePBX installed on a micro computer in their network. More specifically, we configure windows hyper-v and it lives in a VM. Why use windows instead of installing it bare metal? If there is an issue on the FreePBX or perhaps someone was added and they want another extension, we install dualmon to the windows machine. Which allows us to be able to remotely access it and in-turn the full FreePBX system including the BIOS. That allows us to remotely make the necessary changes that our client wanted which is far more practical than having to drive out to their location everytime.

This document is the first of two. This document is meant to outline and track what I do as a whole for the FreePBX while the second document will be a straight forward guide to install the system. I may change this by having a Full install guide if all of our prep work is thrown out the window while the second is a quick install having some things already prepared for us.
