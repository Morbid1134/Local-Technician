# Local-Technician

This repository serves as a living record of my hands-on experience in my first role as an IT Technician. It is not designed to be a polished portfolio or a curated showcase for potential employers. Instead, it captures the real-world, day-to-day tasks I performâ€”documented with transparency and practicality.

Some methods may not align with conventional best practices, but in this environment, we often follow the principle: if it works, it works. My goal is to document these processes in a structured manner, demystify the field for newcomers, and provide a candid look at what working in IT support actually entails.
